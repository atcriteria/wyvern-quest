                Wyvern-Quest was made for the sole function of receiving and displaying Wyvern players performances in the LRD end-game zone. The goal is to inspire competition or simply display metrics to those interested.

                Currently the LRD system is invite-only in-game, though everyone is eligible to participate. The goal is to balance and collect data in a slower cadence until I feel it is in a pretty decent spot balance wise (and stability) to justify adding a permanent location in game. Once that happens, the system will be entirely automated.
